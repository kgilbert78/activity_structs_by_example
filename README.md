# About

The activity at the bottom of the [Rust by Example: 3.1 Structures](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/custom_types/structs.html) page, using the starter code on that page.

### [Activity](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/custom_types/structs.html#activity)

1. Add a function `rect_area` which calculates the area of a `Rectangle` (try using nested destructuring).
2. Add a function `square` which takes a `Point` and a `f32` as arguments, and returns a `Rectangle` with its top left corner on the point, and a width and height corresponding to the `f32`.
